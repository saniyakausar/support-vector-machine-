1) What is SVM ? 
Support Vector Machine uses classification algorithms  for two group, classification and regression analysis.
Supervised machine learning model.
SVM constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in high or infinite dimensional space.

2) Applications 
Text and hypertext categorization 
Classification of images
Classification of satellite data like SAR 
Handwritten characters can be recognized 
Permutation tests 

3) Implementation of SVM for Cancer cell 
Goal :
To create a classification model that looks at predicts if the cancer diagnosis is benign or malignant based on several features
Problem formulation :
It is concerned with identification of cancer, like clump thickness, uniformity of cell size, uniformity of the cell form etc. 
Using machine learning we apply SVM algorithm to the cancer dataset 

4) Steps to be followed :
Gather the data/ dataset.
Import packages.
Loading the data.
Exploring the data.
Splitting it 
Generating the model.
Model evaluation 

5) Advantages 
Effective in high dimensional space 
It is memory efficient
It works really well with a clear margin of separation  
Effective in cases where number of dimension is greater than the number of samples

6) Disadvantages 
It doesn't perform well in large data set 
Doesn’t perform well, when the data set has more noise
Its doesn’t directly provide probability estimation
